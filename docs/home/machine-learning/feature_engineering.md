# Feature Engineering

## :label: What is feature engineering

Feature engineering is the ‘art’ of formulating useful features from existing data following the target to be learned and the machine learning model used. It involves transforming data to forms that better relate to the underlying target to be learned.  When done right, feature engineering can augment the value of your existing data and improve the performance of your machine learning models. On the other hand, using bad features may require you to build much more complex models to achieve the same level of performance.

## Common techniques for feature engineering

* Imputation
* Handling Outliers
* Binning
* Log Transform
* One-Hot Encoding
* Grouping Operations
* Feature Split
* Scaling
* Extracting Date
